\section{Changelog for dev release v23:}
Issues Resolved:\newline
1. Read\_file when new profile created.\newline
2. Reduced size of the uname\_acceptance BMP as well as the text\_image created using allocBitmap().\newline
3. Cutscene display function under test environment -- needs more work. Primary part completed to a certain extent.\newline

Issues to be resolved:\newline
1. Design cutscene display function -- check proper levelNum and missionNum for this. Work is underway.\newline
2. Correct the algorithm for redisplaying the cutscene based on the missionComplete status.\newline
3. Check out bug that might exist in the display\_terminal handle event function.\newline

\section{Note to developers}
This is another update. Work is going on. I have some distractions coming up and these might get stronger in the near future. I just want you guys to pray that I can get what I want to create/do.\newline

Happy Coding!!!\newline
