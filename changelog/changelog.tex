\section{Note to developers}
Well, it seems that I have uploaded after a long time. I will try to upload as quickly as possible since the deadline is approaching. Speaking of coders -- who had joined this project of ours -- I have received very less effort from you. Solemnly urging you to please give your inputs for the same. Apart from that I ask the people who download the updates from here to absolve as I was very busy the past few days. I will try to provide the updates as soon as possible. Otherwise you can also check for the minor updates in github where I am trying to make it a habit to update all the time.\newline

P.S. The music is of Skyrim -- main theme and is and will not be the main theme of m3m0ry-l3ak. I just added it to see how it sounds in the fullscreen mode. The current update release has the settings set up in the fulscreen mode. So beware before pressing KEY\_F9.\newline
