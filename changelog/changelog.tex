\section{Changelog for dev release v31:}
Issues Resolved:\newline
1. Select functions created to select CPU, NICCard, RAM and other data values related to the mentioned like the transfer rate, the capacity of RAM, the name of the CPU, it's operating frequency.\newline
2. Overloaded fileWrite and fileRead functions created. Need to change parameters written to properly create cfgFile.\newline

Issues to be resolved:\newline
1. Enhancement : Rather than switching the display resoluion while displaying the bootText, stretch\_blit the parent bootText image.\newline
2. Enhancement : Create single handler for all events for selectImg -- cfgSelect.\newline
3. Change writeParam -- remomve the string params that were written by the identifier variables that have been declared -- in the overloaded fileWrite and fileRead function. Read failure in second string written after the firs string is written and read. Writing occurs fine. Read doesn't produce correct results in the resulting var.\newline
4. Verify function and flow for reading the cfg file and display of sysConfig when main gameplay starts.\newline
