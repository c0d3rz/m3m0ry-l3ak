\section{Changelog for dev release v23:}
Issues Resolved:\newline
1. Dummy text given for the level display. Work is going on in the testBed.\newline
2. display\_cutscene() function created -- needs more work in the near future.\newline

Issues to be resolved:\newline
1. Make the display\_intro(int mode) function generic so that it shows the appropriate cutscene based on the mode.\newline
2. Write and implement the LevenShtein distance in the nxClParser component -- core of the display\_terminal() function.\newline
3. Also implement AI -- check out the type of AI to be implemented for this game.\newline

\section{Note to developers}
I would have updated long ago but for some internet issues I got stuck up and hence the delay in uploading the recent update. This update has the main.cpp file commented since the work for the display\_intro() function is going on in the test bed. The aspiring devs can also call the function from the main.cpp file -- just check out the test.cpp file for the implementation technique.\newline

Happy Coding!!!\newline
