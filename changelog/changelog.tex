\section{Changelog for dev release v22:}
Issues Resolved:\newline
1. Read\_file when new profile created.\newline
2. Reduced size of the uname\_acceptance BMP as well as the text\_image created using allocBitmap().\newline
3. Cutscene display function under test environment -- needs more work. Primary part completed to a certain extent.\newline
4. Bug in handle\_event function removed -- specific checking enabled for in-game and start-game.\newline

Issues to be resolved:\newline
1. Design cutscene display function -- check proper levelNum and missionNum for this. Work is underway.\newline
2. Correct the algorithm for redisplaying the cutscene based on the missionComplete status.\newline

\section{Note to developers}
This is another update. Work is going on. I have some distractions coming up and these might get stronger in the near future. I just want you guys to pray that I can get what I want to create/do.\newline

P.S. I thought of not naming this update as v22 dev release but for some reason I thought what the hell.\newline

Happy Coding!!!\newline
