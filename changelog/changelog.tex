\section{Changelog for dev release v27:}
Issues Resolved:\newline
1. Cutscene display for levelZero completed. Sfx implementation for the display of the cutscene also done.\newline
2. Incrementing the usrLevel value and writing the same in the profile file -- working properly.\newline

Issues to be resolved:\newline
1. Develop the rest of the gameplay design. Current work in this respect -- design the working of the main engine.\newline
2. Develop the multi-window approach. Test Bed implementation has started, enable\_hardware\_cursor() working properly. Might have to check some flags before calling the same.[Discrepancies that might exist in other installations or PCs]\newline
3. Check out threading concept for the multi-window approach. This might be required since there might be a number
of threads that will be required for the same.\newline
4. display\_terminal() function -\> libNxParser class implementation, needs to be tweaked and embedded in the main code.\newline

\section{Note to developers}
Hi dear friends, who might be thinking when a new update is about to come, I am sorry to disappoint you. I have been working alone for quite a time and hence the delay in the updates. Not that I have been working very hard at this, but I have become very lazy. May the divine force help me out.\newline
On a completely different note, check out the gameplay video of God of War - Ascension Campaign mode in E3 2012. It is really amazing[at least for a die hard fan like me, this was a big issue...the attacks are a bit more brutal]\newline
Hoping to get a solution to the multi-window approach that I have in mind. The problem how do I switch from one window having different functionality to another without sacrificing anything in either/all of them[Here again I need help, either from you guys or from the divine force].\newline
