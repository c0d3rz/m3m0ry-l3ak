\section{Note to developers}
Hello fellow coders, I am sorry for the late update. But this was because of the low number of inputs from other people. However, now the update is here. You will love it. The libSound module has been redesigned for robust performance. The earlier version was giving huge issues, that might have happened because of my sloppy coding. Even though I changed, I seemed to get into more and more trouble. Hence the redesign. Still now, I am having some problems. But this update is necessary since this marks the first sign that the cutscene display is about to end.\newline
