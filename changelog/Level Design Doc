Level Design document

Current state of the user
Level Num = 0;	// needs to be incremented to level 1
missionNum = 0;	// no need of incrementing

isMissionComplete->Flag_type_int = InComplete	// no change
isLevelComplete->Flag_type_int = InComplete		// no change

After the increment of the levelNumber:
1. fileWrite(change(newLevelNum))->levelNumber; rest no change
2. display main_bg()->dBuffer; display_time()-> right hand top corner
3. Ask user to make the system -> along with that display the accBal
4. after choosing the system config, fileWrite(systemConfig)->NewFile()

After this the design of the main game engine along with other parts will be starting -- this is where the game play will
start for the game

Level 1, Mission 1 - Official Name: .Init()
Level 1, Mission 2 - Official Name: .argv[1]	// the first target



Important: Implement salted md5 check for the profile and other files that are going to be used for the game
