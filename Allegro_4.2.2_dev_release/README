Issues to be resolved:
1. Create the gfx for the "warning! memory leak" and make it appear at multiple places on the screen. Basically that will be a blitting function call -- a multiple call that will be showing it in different places on the screen.Formulate some thing for this too.
2. Play distort_gfx_sfx properly. Twekaing of the timing is required.
3. Replace the current cutscene BG sfx with a better one.

Issues Resolved:
1. LibSound tweaked to a proper extent.
2. Distort sound placed and called for once. Timings for short interval done.

P.S. Have become lazy and hence the delay in the upload. Will also try to upload in the google code dump
