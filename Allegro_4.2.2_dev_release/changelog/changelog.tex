\section{Note to developers}
Have removed some people from the contributor side -- since they haven't been giving me any inputs. So I am guessing that these people were not interested in the project anymore. I am also getting frustrated due to the lack of coders for my project. I need some people who can code. In case you guys know someone who might be interested in coding regardless of the language(Of course, I will not ask to code in Java!!!! I hate that language too.) and type of game -- please ask him/her to join me. I need a coder who can help me out now.\newline
