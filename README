Issues to be resolved:
1. Create the gfx for the "warning! memory leak" and make it appear at multiple places on the screen. Basically that will be a blitting function call -- a multiple call that will be showing it in different places on the screen.Formulate some thing for this too.
2. Tweak the libSound module for using the other sounds -- appropriate for different situations.
3. Tweak the screen_tear display to display the screen tear in a much more natural way. Add sfx for the same. Sfx has already been created -- just the pitch of the final version is a bit low. Need more high pitch. 

P.S. Masked blit might be required for blitting in different desktops with different resolutions. Have to check that part. Another formlation for doing the aforementioned might be required for the bmpBlitx, bmpBlity pos for the masked_blit or the stretched_blit. 

P.P.S. Formulate some calculation method for determining the display of the text that will be written in the txtBmp created in the _seq_display_() function.

P.P.P.S. Hope this project of mine gets finished properly and becomes at least presentable.
