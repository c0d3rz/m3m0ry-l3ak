Issues to be resolved:
1. Create the gfx for the "warning! memory leak" and make it appear at multiple places on the screen. Basically that will be a blitting function call -- a multiple call that will be showing it in different places on the screen.Formulate some thing for this too.
2. Tweak the libSound module for using the other sounds -- appropriate for different situations.

Issues Resolved:
1. screen disturbance completed using the sine amplitude function of Amplitude modulation. Extra clear_to_color() function call has been eliminated.

Next work needs to be done with the libSnd module for the sfx and the gfx_distort_frame sync.

P.S. Masked blit might be required for blitting in different desktops with different resolutions. Have to check that part. Another formlation for doing the aforementioned might be required for the bmpBlitx, bmpBlity pos for the masked_blit or the stretched_blit. 

P.P.S. Formulate some calculation method for determining the display of the text that will be written in the txtBmp created in the _seq_display_() function.

P.P.P.S. Need to update in Twitter account too. Check out war10ck on twitter.
